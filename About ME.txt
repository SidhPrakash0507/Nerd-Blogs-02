About Me:

I'm Sidh Prakash, and my fascination with computers and gadgets has been a driving force in my life since childhood. My journey into the world of programming began in 2019 when I was introduced to Q basic and QB64 languages during my school days. While these languages may not be as mainstream as C++, Java, or Python, they provided me with a solid foundation and an initial glimpse into the world of programming.

The lockdown and the COVID-19 pandemic presented an opportunity for me to dive deeper into programming. During this time, I explored the basics of programming and familiarized myself with popular languages such as Python, HTML, and CSS for website development. As I progressed, I also gained proficiency in C++ and JavaScript, albeit at a foundational level.

As technology continued to advance, my curiosity led me to the realm of artificial intelligence (AI). With the launch of ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Gemini, and other AI tools, I delved into machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, and utilized libraries like Matplotlib, Pandas, and NumPy. Platforms like Replit and GravityWrite further enriched my learning experience.
